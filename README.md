# JS Code Prettifier
Highlights code snippets on your blog. Under the hood, relies on Google's [JS Code Prettifier](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) to highlight code snippets in blog posts.

Unlike [its predecessor](https://github.com/janboddez/code-prettifier), this plugin uses JavaScript (like Code Prettifier itself) as a trigger.
